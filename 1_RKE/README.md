# RKE(Remote Keyless Entry)
## Introduction
A Remote Keyless Entry System is an electronic lock that controls vehicle or building access without the use of a typical mechanical key. "Keyless entry" or "remote central locking" are other terms for "remote keyless system" (RKS). It's a key that can be triggered by a handheld device or by proximity. It works in the same way as a traditional automobile key but without the need for physical touch. When the remote is within range of the vehicle, hitting a button on the remote can lock or unlock the doors, among other things.
