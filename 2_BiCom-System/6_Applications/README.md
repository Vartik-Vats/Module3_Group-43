* Bi-directional communication makes this possible. When the door handle is pulled (or some similar trigger is activated) the base unit located within the vehicle emits a short range, low frequency signal- polling for a nearby key fob transponder.
* If present, the key fob recognizes the signal and responds with a UHF (ultra-high frequency) signal, transmitting a code to be authenticated by the base unit encryption firmware, such as Microchip Technology's Keylock.
