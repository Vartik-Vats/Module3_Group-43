# RKE - Remote Keyless Entry System
## Introduction
A Remote Keyless Entry System is an electronic lock that controls vehicle or building access without the use of a typical mechanical key. "Keyless entry" or "remote central locking" are other terms for "remote keyless system" (RKS). It's a key that can be triggered by a handheld device or by proximity. It works in the same way as a traditional automobile key but without the need for physical touch. When the remote is within range of the vehicle, hitting a button on the remote can lock or unlock the doors, among other things.
## Research
RKE (remote keyless entry) is an electronic access control system that may be operated from a distance. RKEs, which are commonly used to remotely lock or unlock doors, need the end user to perform an action that causes a physical or software key fob to send a radio signal to a receiver that controls an electronic lock. The action is usually performed by pressing a button on a physical fob or a mobile app.
Remote keyless entry (RKE), which is commonly used to protect vehicles from theft, contrasts with passive keyless entry (PKE), which does not require any action on the end user's part. Most RKEs operate at 315 MHz for North American-made vehicles and 433.92 MHz for European, Japanese, and Asian vehicles.
